<h1>Google Earth UK Traffic Data Overlay </h1>
<p class="announce"><strong>01 August 2006:</strong>I can't believe how quickly time flies! Anyway I have now seperated the data out into seperate files, althought the original is still there. The files are as follows:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://bbc.blueghost.co.uk/earth/overlay.kml">http://bbc.blueghost.co.uk/earth/overlay.kml</a> - Complete file with Traffic and Rail Info - 180 kb compressed (2MB un-compressed)</li>
<li><a href="http://bbc.blueghost.co.uk/earth/rail.kml">http://bbc.blueghost.co.uk/earth/rail.kml</a> - Rail Delays only - 3 kb compressed (16kb un-compressed)</li>
<li><a href="http://bbc.blueghost.co.uk/earth/stations.kml">http://bbc.blueghost.co.uk/earth/stations.kml</a> - Network Link, shows maximum of 100 stations in your current view point </li>
<li>http://bbc.blueghost.co.uk/earth/stations_all.kml - All UK Stations - 60 kb compressed (1MB un-compressed) - I find this sometimes crashes Google Earth </li>
<li><a href="http://bbc.blueghost.co.uk/earth/travel.kml">http://bbc.blueghost.co.uk/earth/travel.kml</a> - Travel Delays only - 120 kb compressed (1.2MB un-compressed)</li>
</ul>
<p class="announce">
I will attempt to make some dynamic kml files soon (i.e ones that only show the data in the current viewing area)
</p>

<p class="announce"><strong>5 November 2005:</strong>All Railway stations should now be in the data file. This has been provided by Jonathan Brown from the <a href="http://bbs.keyhole.com/ubb/showflat.php/Cat/0/Number/148131/page/0/fpart/3/vc/1" target="_blank">Keyhole BBS, see the topic in question</a></p>
<p class="announce"><strong>23 October:</strong>This data may not have been updated for the past few days because some of the BBC data is misssing (certain train company delay files) - this caused the update script to fail. I have since fixed this</p>
<p>
  After a request a while ago from Russell Dyas ( <a href="http://www.russdev.com/" target="_blank">http://www.russdev.com/</a> ) for a traffic overlay for Google Earth from my backstage project I have finally managed to complete his request. At the time I had no time to do it myself and had no idea how to do Google Earth stuff, but gave him directions to my parsed XML files.</p>
<p class="announce">This evening I had nothing to do so quickly made this Google Earth file: <a href="http://bbc.blueghost.co.uk/earth/overlay.kml">http://bbc.blueghost.co.uk/earth/overlay.kml.</a> (Firefox users may need to download the file to their hard disk and open it there - or maybe it's just my PC that has this problem) </p>

<p>The data is automatically updated every half an hour (or you can do it manually in Google Earth, although my data is only updated every 30 mins). </p>
<p>Thanks to my <a href="http://bbc.blueghost.co.uk" target="_blank">bbc.blueghost.co.uk</a> project the conversion from the bbc supplied tpeg data files to kml was easy.</p>
<p>This is my first, and very quickly done, Google Earth overlay, please email me at the address below with any hints/comments/suggestions.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>This site overlays various bits of <a href="#data" title="Find out more on the data used">data</a> onto  <a href="http://earth.google.com" target="_blank">Google Earth.</a></p>

<h1>About Traffic Data</h1>
<hr />
<p><br />
  This Data come from the <a target="_blank" href="http://backstage.bbc.co.uk/data/TravelFeeds?v=138u">BBC's TPEG Travel Feeds</a>.
  They are converted to an easier format via PHP and then down to KML for Google Earth.<br />
  I convert them from TPEG files as the RSS feeds don't contain Geographical co-ordinates to position reports on the Google Map.
</p>
<p>The data is automatically updated every <s>hour</s> 30 minutes, <s>i may cut this to half an hour depending on how much bandwidth it takes up</s> - DONE

<h1>About Live Departure Boards</h1>
<hr />
<p>I use the virgin live departure boards as they still use the old national rail interface (although with Virgin Branding). I prefer the old style as it is easier to understand and contains no adverts. The new national rail website is harder to follow and contains adverts hence I don't link to it.</p>
