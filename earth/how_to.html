<h1>Google Maps (local) and Earth BBC Travel data overlays</h1>
<div class="announce"><strong>24 October:</strong>This is just a brief overiew of how I transform the <a href="http://backstage.bbc.co.uk" target="_blank">BBC's backstage data</a> to be used on my <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk" target="_blank">google maps</a> (<a href="http://bbc.blueghost.co.uk">link to project</a>) and <a href="http://earth.google.com" target="_blank">google earth</a> (<a href="http://bbc.blueghost.co.uk/earth/" target="_blank">link to project</a>) backstage projects. </div>
<p>Here are the various steps taken to transform the data:</p>
<ol>
  <li>A cron job runs an update script every 30 minutes (for the weather data from <a href="http://www.weather.com/?prod=xoap&amp;par=1009003705" target="_blank">weather.com&reg;</a> a similar script is run every 30 minutes for current conditions and every 12 hours for 10 day conditions)</li>
  <li>First to be tackled is the data for each county/area.
    <ul>
      <li>each location is stored in a database, this list is fetched</li>
      <li>for each location the xml data file is copied from the bbc to the local server</li>
      <li>each xml file is stored in TPEG format, this is converted via a home made parser into a more simpler xml file.
        <ul>
          <li>the file contains each alert with the relevant:
            <ul>
              <li>source</li>
              <li>summary</li>
              <li>lat &amp; long coordinates of the alert - plus any other points such as the start and end points of a delay </li>
              <li>severity of the delay</li>
              </ul>
          </li>
          <li>the conversion parses the TPEG file as xml and returns a new xml file that has removed all of the stuff I don't need.</li>
          </ul>
      </li>
      <li>at the same time the parser also produes KML output for the google earth data file.</li>
      <li>each counties bit of data is then written to a unique file for that county.</li>
      <li>for the google earth data file, the bits of data are separated by Folders and combined together into one file that forms the single data file.  </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The same is then done for the rail data</li>
  <li>For the google earth data, the single file (around 500kb) is zipped to a much smaller files (around 60kb) and renamed kmz</li>
  </ol>
<p>This is a very simple and brief overview, I will explain things in more detail when I get the chance. </p>
